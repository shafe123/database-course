# Database Course
This content is largely from my time as an instructor at USMA.

The course is largely broken down into three sections:

1. Database Queries
2. Database Design
3. Database Applications

Feel free to raise an issue if you run into any problems.

## Tools
You will need the following tools to do the full course:
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Client
- Python
- Django
- Python mysql connector

Some optional tools that are useful:
- VS Code
- MySQL extension for VS Code
- Draw.io

Much of the examples are provided in the .mysql-notebook format.  This works well with the MySQL extension for VS Code.  
Alternatively, you can use the extractor script in the root directory to convert the notebooks to raw .sql files.

## Good luck!
